# TourismForecasting

This repository contains code and resources for forecasting tourism data using various machine learning models. The project was developed as part of my master's thesis.

## Repository Structure

- **01_Randforest.py**: Implements the Random Forest model for initial data analysis and forecasting.
- **01_SARIMAX.py**: Implements the SARIMAX model for initial data analysis and forecasting.
- **02_Randforest.py**: Refines the Random Forest model with additional parameters and data preprocessing.
- **02_SARIMAX.py**: Refines the SARIMAX model with additional parameters and data preprocessing.
- **03_Randforest.py**: Final version of the Random Forest model with optimized parameters.
- **03_SARIMAX.py**: Final version of the SARIMAX model with optimized parameters.
- **2425preview.py**: Generates the forecast for the years 2024 and 2025.
- **train_test_plot.py**: Plots the distribution of the training and testing datasets.
- **variablecorrelation.py**: Presents the correlation of non-object type variables in the dataset with the target variable (TOL).
- **plot.py**: Helps in reproducing the graphs.
- **Dataset_Final.xlsx**: The dataset used by the models.

## Results

- ***./Result Graphs***: Contains graphs comparing the predicted results with the actual data from the developed dataset.
- ***./Results***: Contains Excel documents with the predicted values and evaluation metrics calculated by the different models and versions.

The ***./Accessories*** folder contains text documents that helped organize the information better.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pedrorocha02/TourismForecasting.git

2. Execute the models and wait for the graph reproduction:
    py ./xx_model.py

3. Check the results at the ***./Results*** folder
